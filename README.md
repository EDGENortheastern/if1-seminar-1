## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a platform for sharing, managing, and collaborating on projects. It uses **Git**, a version control system, to track changes and make teamwork simple and efficient. GitHub is widely used in both professional and open-source development, making it a vital tool for developers.

### Key Features of GitHub:
- **Repositories (Repos):** Where projects live and grow.
- **Issues:** A feature for tracking bugs, suggesting ideas, and organising tasks.
- **Pull Requests (PRs):** Propose and discuss changes before merging them into the main project.
- **ReadMe Files:** Provide a welcoming introduction and guide for using a project.
