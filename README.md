# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the IFCS1 GitHub Repository

This repository is part of the **Intensive Foundation to Computer Science and Programming (IFCS1)** course. Here, you'll learn the fundamentals of programming and software development while mastering collaboration skills through GitHub. 

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a platform for sharing, managing, and collaborating on projects. It uses **Git**, a version control system, to track changes and make teamwork simple and efficient. GitHub is widely used in both professional and open-source development, making it a vital tool for developers.

### Key Features of GitHub:
- **Repositories (Repos):** Where projects live and grow.
- **Issues:** A feature for tracking bugs, suggesting ideas, and organising tasks.
- **Pull Requests (PRs):** Propose and discuss changes before merging them into the main project.
- **ReadMe Files:** Provide a welcoming introduction and guide for using a project.

## Why GitHub for IFCS?

In this course, GitHub will help you:
- Collaborate on code and documentation with your cohort;
- Develop professional skills in software development.

## What You'll Do

1. **Create a GitHub Account:**  
   - Visit [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up if you don't already have an account.

2. **Understand Issues:**  
   - Learn how to create and resolve issues. These will help you discuss ideas, assign tasks, and track bugs.

3. **Get Added as a Collaborator:**  
   - You'll need to be invited to this repository. Once added, you'll be able to contribute directly.

## Next Steps
- [Create Your GitHub Account](https://github.com/)  
- Start exploring issues  
- Join the repo and make your first contribution to the ReadMe!

## TechDocs Tips

```bash
git clone git@github.com:EDGENortheastern/if1-seminar-1.git
```

```python
import random

def equation_gen():
    '''
    here goes docstring
    '''
    unknown_x = random.randint(1, 10)
    coef_a = random.randint(1, 10)
    result = coef_a * unknown_x
    return str(coef_a) + ' * x = ' + str(result), unknown_x

print("solve the equation " + equation_gen()[0])
user_input = int(input("x = "))
print(type(user_input))
print(type(equation_gen()[1]))
if user_input == equation_gen()[1]:
    print("Correct!")
else:
    print("Incorrect!")

# Added by Mariano Palomares on 10/07/2025 as an example for the seminar 2.

## Example of modification on the `README.md` file
Created by @PalomaresM 

``sql
SELECT 1::integer as id
```

```python
print("Hi class!)
```
I have left some `issues` because I would like a code review from Katia in order to submit some changes so I can review the required changes in Github.
